## Data cleaning and visualization
For this visualization project ,I will be answering the questions asked by the CEO and CMO of a company using Power BI tools
The first thing I did after getting the data set was cleaning the data .I removed data that could bring errors to the analysis such as removing zero values from the prices column and also removing values that were not up to 1 unit or were negatives values from the quantity column(the items that were returned to the company after purchase were represented with negative values).After cleaning the data I proceeded to answering the questions below with visuals and stating the insight that can be gotten from the visuals
### Question 1 
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur.
Insight: This visual will be helpful to forecast for next year.
### Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.
Insight: This visual will be helpful to show countries to focus on and knowing the expected quantities needed to satisfy the market there.
### Question 3 
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers.
Insight: This visual helps to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
### Question 4 
The CEO wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom .
Insight: This visual will show the demand for their products and countries that have expansion opportunities .This will generate more business from these countries.
